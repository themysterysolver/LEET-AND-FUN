JOURNEY OF THAT 1 HARD QUESTION!!!!
------------------------------------------------
This is really weird,me solving a hard problem.
But hey here I am,I solved my very 1st hard problem.
#42.Trapping Rain Water
---------------------------------------------------
Let me tell u something that intrests you.But that part is for latter.Let me tell about my past self,
I am tottaly new to programming and Idk any concepts or dsa algo during that time,even though I compleetd solid 2yrs in MIT persuing CSE.
I was so messed on C,DSA.
-----------------------------------------------------
After months later I started my coding jouney on leetcode,to be specific on 21st July 2024.
I implemented code in py,py3,java on DSA concepts.
I learnt a lot about coding,dsa,problem solving,time complexity,optimization of code,understanding and 
interrupting the q as it said,looking for constarints,dry-run,
handling edge cases in this span of time.(21st July 2024-2nd August 2024(This will continue.....)).
what I realsied after solving a lot of medium and easy question is that(around 100+ problems),
hard problems are still pretty hard both logic wise and implementaion wise.
I decided to solve hard problems after I soled 100medium problems,
BUT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 02-10-2024
I solved my 200+problems on leetcode,I am happy for my efforts.
Then a radnom thought hit my mind,it told me to try a hard.
I searched concept wise,I searched for 2pointers question,coz I am weak at it.My mental state is to quit solving the problem I choose,
coz IT'S A HARD PROBLEM!!
This didn't happen either,I have previously soved a question on leetcode to find the maximum rainwater collected.
which uses greedy,2pointer.{#11.conatains with most water}
I saw a similar question,which was trapping rainwater.So I choose on a intent to solve it(not like I meant it,as I said before)!!!
After I clicked this question I realised this question is one of the attempted!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then some random thought made me forget when I tried this problem,but after reading this question I felt it in my heart!
I felt like this was the first problem I ever tried.But I am not sure though,I didn't care much.I just wanted to solve a hard question,THIS QUESTION!
I started to read a solution,then watch a video,by the middle of the video I fughred out the logic.
I started my code,in python ofc!
I completed the code under less than 5mins.I was scared a lil.
I clciked the run buttom,at the very first try......Bammmm!!!
Accepted!!!
I submitted it..........dammmm!!IT GOT ACCEPTED!!
This is unexpected!!Not completeley unexpected,I beleievd my logic was correct for sure,but i dind't have faith in me tbh.
After completing the code one thing reminded me,Is this the first q I ever really coded in leetcode??
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THEN I GOT THIS MEMORY FROM MY CORNER OF MY SMALL BRAIN!
This is the very first,the very first problem I ever tried to solve in leetcode at HPC lab,MIT.
This was 6months ago "april 5,2024".I tried that problem ,coz I heard Hard questions are hard,tricky and difficult.And prabha likes do difficult things.
I coded that on c,using some logic in my lab.I didn't solve it.And I didn't care much,as it is normal for prabha to not code,back then.
But I am not sure abt it though.It's just a memory and I am not sure about it.
I opened leetcode,opened submissions.To skip large abount of sumbission log.I had to skip my 575 submissions.
So I Changed the url to go back to the very first one.I tried typing 10,15.What I realsied is it just took me couple of weeks back.
So I typed 30 in url to go to page 30,If I am lucky enough I would be at my last page.I wasn't at the last page.It was empty.
Then I clicked newest on bottom left of the page.
WOW...to my suprise I was at my bery first submission page.And my memory ws right.This was my very first question I tried!
(If I am tooo large off the margin(ex 50),I should go back page by page by clciking newest(20 times).
I found this on my research[I just typed 40 lol,while typing this log])
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here I am today,Solving the very first hard question which was my first q on leetcode that i ever tried.
what a coincidence!!
I felt like I should type it out to capture/record this beautiful feeling.
Even though I am bad at my english and grammar,I jsut typed it out.
It would be a pleasant memory reading this after long time.

Thx to the readers who read this complete log,bearing my english and my log!
Thx for readin once again,
continue learning,

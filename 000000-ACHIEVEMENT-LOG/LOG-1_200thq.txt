**LOG-1**
I am excited to say I solved my 200th question on leetcode.
Which is Minesweeper.
#529.Minesweeper
I wanted my 200th q to be special,so I choose a graph,bfs question.which is medium, and I am excited.
Coz I never knew how to play Minesweeper,I learn that this morning regarding the play.
If you are reading my log,I will Teach you how to play.

MINESWEEPER RULES:
the box you may click may or maynot conatina mines.
But if you click a blank space,where there is bomb adjacent to the block you touched,it reveals the number of adjacenet bombs on the square itself.
Else if there is no bomb it expands until it see a bomb,expanding of blank boxes stop only if reaches a bomb.
Adjaceny for a block is all available adjacent 8 boxes,except the border boxes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coding this was really fun,I did everything by myself.
No GPT even for logics,debugging or code optimization,nor I reffered solution.
The best part is the code got submitted on single submit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a sad thing about how I am doing this 200th q.Previosly till 190,I had my problme count on easy and medium as 108,82 respectively.So my idea is to get 110 and 90 on easy,hard.
But my recent idea or aim to get monthly badge messed an extra easy q when I am already at my limit on 110 easy,so that was lil bad!

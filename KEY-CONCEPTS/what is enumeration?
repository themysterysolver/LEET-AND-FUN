Enumeration in DSA:
In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), enumeration refers to systematically listing all possible solutions, configurations, or items in a set, often to solve a problem or analyze data.

Key Points:

It involves generating all possible combinations, permutations, or subsets of elements.
Commonly used in brute-force approaches to ensure no potential solution is missed.
It can be optimized using techniques like pruning to skip unnecessary computations (e.g., using recursion or backtracking).
Examples in DSA:

Generating subsets of an array (power set).
Enumerating all paths in a graph.
Listing all permutations of a string or numbers.
